# AdventOfCode-solution

https://adventofcode.com/ solution using TypeScript running under Deno https://deno.land/

History - 2022/January

I'm trying to learn Web Development.

Later I was trying to learn Deno ( / TypeScript / JavaScript ) to be my back-end, then I came across the site of AdventOfCode.

And then, I was hooked.


Usage in general:

1. for those with input.txt file

   prompt> deno run --allow-read mod.N.ts
     where N is either 1 or 2 or none at all

2. for no input file

   prompt> deno run mod.N.ts
